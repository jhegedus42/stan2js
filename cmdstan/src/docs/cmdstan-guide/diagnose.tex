\chapter{{\tt\bfseries diagnose}: Diagnosing Biased Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Inferences}\label{diagnose.chapter}

\noindent
\CmdStan is distributed with a utility that is able to read in and
analyze the output of one or more Markov chains to check for the
following potential problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Transitions that hit the maximum treedepth
\item Divergent transitions
\item Low E-BFMI values
\item Low effective sample sizes
\item High $\hat{R}$ values
\end{itemize}

The meanings of several of these problems are discussed in
\url{http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#runtime-warnings}
and \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434}.


\section{Building the {\tt\bfseries diagnose} Command}

\CmdStan's \code{diagnose} command is built along with \code{stanc} into
the \code{bin} directory. It can be compiled directly using the
makefile as follows.
%
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make bin/diagnose
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
%

\section{Running the {\tt\bfseries diagnose} Command}

The \code{diagnose} command is executed on one or more output files,
which are provided as command-line arguments separated by spaces.
If there are no apparent problems with the output files passed to
\code{bin/diagnose}, it outputs a message that all transitions
are within treedepth limit and that no divergent transitions were found.

It problems are detected, it outputs a summary of the problem along with
possible ways to mitigate it. As an example,  we use the
the ``eight schools'' model from Stan's example models and
its corresponding data.%
%
\footnote{The model and associated data files are here:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \url{https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/master/misc/eight_schools/eight_schools.stan}
  \item
    \url{https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/master/misc/eight_schools/eight_schools.data.R}
  \end{itemize}
}
The model is run with four chains and the random seed 12345, leaving
the output files \code{eight\_schools1.csv}, \code{eight\_schools2.csv},
etc. The \code{diagnose} command is then run as follows:
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> bin/diagnose eight_schools*.csv
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
The result of \code{bin/diagnose} is displayed in
\reffigure{bin-diagnose-eg}, indicating two problems, one with
divergent transitions, and one indicating a low E-BFMI, and possible
ways to solve these problems. The first problem indicates that the
parameter \code{delta} of the sampling algorithm needs to be
increased. Since the contents of \code{eight\_schools1.csv} contains
the lines
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}
#     adapt
#       engaged = 1 (Default)
#       gamma = 0.050000000000000003 (Default)
#       delta = 0.80000000000000004 (Default)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
this suggests that \code{delta} should be increased beyond
0.8. Following section~\ref{detailed-command-arguments.section}, this
suggests that the model perhaps should be rerun as follows:
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> for i in {1..4}
  do
    ./eight_schools sample adapt delta=0.9 \
       random seed=12345 id=$i data \
       file=eight_schools.data.R \
       output file=eight_schools$i.csv &
  done
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}


\begin{figure}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\footnotesize]
 Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
 95 of 4000 (2.4%) transitions ended with a divergence.
 These divergent transitions indicate that HMC is not fully
 able to explore the posterior distribution.
 Try increasing adapt delta closer to 1.
 If this doesn't remove all divergences, try to reparameterize the model.

 Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
 The E-BFMI, 0.27, is below the nominal threshold of 0.3 which suggests
 that HMC may have trouble exploring the target distribution.
 If possible, try to reparameterize the model.

The online references (\url{http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#runtime-warnings}
and \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434}) contain suggestions for
other diagnostic warning; however the correct resolution is
necessarily model specific, hence all suggestions general guidelines only.
